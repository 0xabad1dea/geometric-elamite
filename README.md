# Geometric Elamite

Music (midi and mp3) as explained in the paper ["Musical Structure of Geometric Elamite"](https://www.academia.edu/93268214/Musical_Structure_of_Geometric_Elamite) and the script that was used to generate figure 7. You may listen to the mp3s easily [here](https://soundcloud.com/0xabad1dea/sets/geometric-elamite). The soundfont used is Apple's "Persian Santoor."

No attempt has been made to interpret the rhythm, only the pitch. The original tuning was most likely what we could call Pythagorean, but these renderings have been done with standard modern tuning because a Pythagorean one will sound Slightly Wrong to most listeners in a way that will detract from the musicality being conveyed.

As explained in the paper, tablet B was probably meant to loop. The brief pause at the end of D is due to unreadable characters on the tablet.

Since the music comes from ancient tablets, it would be absurd to treat it as anything but public domain. However, attribution of the interpretation to Melissa Elliott / 0xabad1dea is appreciated.
